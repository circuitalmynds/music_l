LYRICS ~

I'm feeling my heart
Beating with the rhythm of her body slowly moves
I love this feeling
Mm-mmm
Yeah, yeah
Well I can't deny it
She turns me on, I can't control this burning desire
I wish we could
Having fun under the sun
I don't know what it is but there is a trick in her
Who works on me
So well
And I can't deny it
She turns me on like a firecracker in the summer sun
I can feel my mind
Slowly fading with the smell of her perfume
And when she's dancing
Oh damn
Mm-mmm

I'm feeling my heart
Beating with the rhythm of her body slowly moves
I love this feeling
Mm-mmm
Yeah, yeah
Well I can't deny it
She turns me on, I can't control this burning desire
I wish we could
Having fun under the sun
I don't know what it is but there is a trick in her
Who works on me
So well
And I can't deny it
She turns me on like a firecracker in the summer sun
I can feel my mind
Slowly fading with the smell of her perfume
And when she's dancing
Oh damn
Mm-mmm

(She turns me on)
